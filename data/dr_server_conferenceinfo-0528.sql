Some classic examples of social goods are, of course, healthcare, safety, environment, democracy, and human rights, but we can add to this classic list even communication, art, entertainment and much more.\r\n\r\nIn this context, the popularity of portable computing devices, like smartphones, tablets, or smart watches combined with the emergence of many other small smart objects with computational, sensing and communication capabilities coupled with the popularity of social networks and new human-technology interaction paradigms is creating unprecedented opportunities for each of us to do something useful, ranging from a single person to the whole world. Furthermore, Internet of Things, Smart-cities, distributed sensing and Fog computing are representative examples of modern ICT paradigms that aim to describe a dynamic and globally cooperative infrastructure built upon objects’ intelligence and self-configuring capabilities. These connected objects are finding their way into our pockets, vehicles, urban areas and infrastructure, thus becoming the very texture of our society and providing us the possibility, but also the responsibility, to shape it.\r\n\r\nIn GOODTECHS we are hence interested in experiences with the design,  implementation, deployment, operation and evaluation of smart objects and technologies for social good. Clearly, we are not considering only the so called first world as the scenario for this evolution; we also refer to those areas where ICT is currently less widespread, hoping that it may represent a societal development opportunity rather than a source for further divide.\r\n\r\nTopics\r\n\r\nAuthors are solicited to submit original, previously unpublished papers in the following, but not limited to topic areas:\r\n\r\n    App concepts and technologies for different mobile platforms\r\n    Blockchain for social good\r\n    Communication between mobile devices\r\n    Content Distribution\r\n    E-learning solutions\r\n    Data collection, organization and dissemination methods\r\n    Delay-tolerant aerial networks and ferrying approaches\r\n    Deployment and field-testing\r\n    Digital tools for art and feelings\r\n    Environment sensing, monitoring and preservation\r\n    Experimental results of communication testbeds\r\n    Game, entertainment, and multimedia applications\r\n    Health and social care\r\n    Human-object interaction\r\n    ICT for development\r\n    Mobile service architectures and frameworks\r\n    Mobility and handover management\r\n    New application scenarios for vehicular communications\r\n    Pervasive and ubiquitous services in cloud and IoT\r\n    Platforms and frameworks for mobile devices\r\n    Privacy issues and solutions\r\n    Protocol design, testing and verification\r\n    Security issues, architectures and solutions\r\n    Smart cities and transportation\r\n    Smart economy solutions: e-banking, e-business\r\n    Smart governance and e-administration\r\n    Smart living and E-health\r\n    Technology addressing the digital divide', '2020-05-05 12:06:27.228181', '0', '0', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '', 'http://goodtechs.eu/', '延期');

While it will be possible to make minor edits to the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline, submissions with “placeholder” abstracts which are rewritten entirely for the full submission may be removed without consideration. It will not be possible to modify the author list nor the author order after the abstract submission deadline.\r\n \r\nAll authors are required to register in CMT and fill out a user information form by Jun 04, 2020. Because of the rapid growth of NeurIPS, all authors and co-authors are expected to be available to review papers, if asked to do so. If all co-authors do not register and enter their information, their submission may be desk rejected.\r\n \r\nIn order to cope with the growing number of submissions, this year we will adopt an “early desk-reject” process involving only Area Chairs and Senior Area Chairs. Area Chairs will be responsible for identifying papers that are very likely to be rejected, and Senior Area Chairs will cross check the selections. These papers will not be further reviewed, and authors will be notified immediately. \r\n \r\nAuthors need to declare if a previous version of their submission was rejected at any peer-reviewed venue within the past 12 months, and, if so, summarize the changes to the current version. This information should be entered into CMT during the submission process.\r\n \r\nIn order to provide a balanced perspective, authors are required to include a statement of the potential broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future societal consequences. Authors should take care to discuss both positive and negative outcomes.\r\n \r\nAuthors are required to provide an explicit disclosure of funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work) that could result in conflicts of interest. This section should be added to the camera-ready version of accepted papers. More information can be found here.\r\n \r\nWe strongly encourage (but do not require) accompanying code and data to be submitted with accepted papers that contribute and present experiments with a new algorithm or new dataset. Moreover, we encourage authors to upload their code as part of their supplementary material at submission time in order to help reviewers assess the quality of the work. Check the policy, guidelines and templates for code submission for further details.\r\n \r\nAs an additional step to make NeurIPS content accessible to those unable to attend the conference, authors of accepted submissions will be required to provide a link to all the following accompanying materials by the camera ready deadline:\r\n3-minute video summarizing the paper\r\nPDF of slides summarizing the paper\r\nPDF of the poster used at the conference\r\nAuthors will be asked to confirm that their submissions accord with the NeurIPS code of conduct.\r\n\r\nFormatting instructions: All submissions must be in PDF format. Submissions are limited to eight content pages, including all figures and tables; additional pages containing a statement of broader impact, acknowledgements and funding disclosures, and references are allowed. You must format your submission using the NeurIPS 2020 LaTeX style file which includes a “preprint” option for non-anonymous preprints posted online. The maximum file size for submissions is 50MB. Submissions that violate the NeurIPS style (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) or page limits may be rejected without further review. If your submission is accepted, you will be allowed a ninth content page for the camera-ready version.\r\n\r\nSupplementary material: Authors may submit up to 100MB of supplementary material, such as proofs, derivations, data, or source code; all supplementary materials must be in PDF or ZIP format. Supplementary material should be material, created by the authors, that directly supports the submission content. Like submissions, supplementary material must be anonymized. To submit supplementary material, first upload your submission. You will then be able to upload supplementary material from the author console. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.\r\n\r\nEvaluation criteria: Submissions that violate the NeurIPS style or page limits, are not within the scope of NeurIPS (see subject areas), are in submission elsewhere, or have already been published elsewhere may be rejected without further review. Submissions that have fatal (confirmed) flaws revealed by the reviewers—including incorrect proofs, flawed or insufficient wet-lab, hardware, or software experiments—may be rejected on that basis, without taking into consideration other criteria. Other submissions will be judged on the basis of their technical quality, novelty, potential impact, and clarity. Typical NeurIPS papers often (but not always) include a mix of algorithmic, theoretical, and experimental results, in varying proportions. While theoretically grounded arguments are encouraged, it is counterproductive to add “decorative math” whose primary purpose is to make the submission look more substantial or even intimidating, without adding significant insight. Algorithmic contributions should have at least an illustration of how the algorithm might eventually materialize into a machine learning application. Submissions will also be considered on ethical grounds. Regardless of scientific quality or contribution, a submission may be rejected for ethical considerations, including methods, applications, or data that create or reinforce unfair bias or that have a primary purpose of harm or injury.  \r\n\r\nDouble-blind reviewing: The reviewing process will be double blind at the level of reviewers and area chairs (i.e., reviewers and area chairs cannot see author identities) but not at the level of senior area chairs and program chairs. During the desk rejection phase, the process will be double blind for senior area chairs as well, who will not be able to see the author\'s identity. As an author, you are responsible for anonymizing your submission. In particular, you should not include author names, author affiliations, or acknowledgements in your submission and you should avoid providing any other identifying information (even in the supplementary material). If you need to cite one of your own papers, you should do so with adequate anonymization to preserve double-blind reviewing. For  instance, write “In the previous work of Smith et al. [1]…” rather than “In our previous work [1]...”). If you need to cite one of your own papers that is in submission to NeurIPS and not available as a non-anonymous preprint, then include a copy of the cited submission in the supplementary material and write “Anonymous et al. [1] concurrently show...”). Supplementary materials and code should also be anonymized (including, for instance, hardcoded paths or URLs that may give away login identifiers or institution).\r\n\r\nPreprints: The existence of non-anonymous preprints (on arXiv, social media, websites, etc.) will not result in rejection. If you choose to use the NeurIPS style for the preprint version, you must use the “preprint” option rather than the “final” option. However, note that your submission to CMT must be always anonymized regardless of whether a preprint has been released. Reviewers will be instructed not to actively look for such preprints, but encountering them will not constitute a conflict of interest. Authors may submit anonymized work to NeurIPS that is already available as a preprint (e.g., on arXiv) without citing it; however, previously published papers by the authors on related topics must be cited (with adequate anonymization to preserve double-blind reviewing).\r\n\r\nDual submissions: Dual submissions will be identified via a combination of automated methods and human (reviewer, area chair, senior area chair, program chair) judgment. NeurIPS coordinates with other conferences to identify dual submissions. Submissions that are identical or substantially similar to papers that are in submission to, have been accepted to, or have been published in other archival conferences, journals, workshops, etc. will be deemed dual submissions. Submissions that are identical or substantially similar to other NeurIPS submissions will also be deemed dual submissions; submissions should be distinct and sufficiently substantial. Note that slicing contributions too thinly may result in submissions being deemed dual submissions. Specifically, a case of slicing too thinly may correspond to two submissions by the same authors that are so similar that publishing one would render the other too incremental to be accepted. The program chairs reserve the right to reject all NeurIPS submissions by all authors of dual submissions, not just those deemed dual submissions. The NeurIPS policy on dual submissions applies for the entire duration of the reviewing process (i.e., from the submission deadline to the notification date). Authors should contact the program chairs if they need further clarification.\r\n\r\nCitation and Comparison: Papers are expected to cite all refereed publications relevant to their content, but authors are excused for not knowing about all non-refereed work (e.g, those appearing on ArXiv). Papers (whether refereed or not) appearing less than two months before the submission deadline are considered contemporaneous to NeurIPS submissions; authors are not obligated to make detailed comparisons to such papers (though, especially for the camera ready versions of accepted papers, authors are encouraged to).\r\n\r\nAuthor responses: Authors will have one week to view and respond to initial reviews. All author responses must be in PDF format. Author responses are limited to one page, including all figures, tables, and references, in the NeurIPS “author response” style; you must use the NeurIPS 2020 author response LaTeX style file. Author responses must not contain external links. The program chairs reserve the right to solicit additional reviews after the author response period.\r\n\r\nPublication of submissions: After decisions have been made, reviews, meta-reviews, and author responses for accepted submissions will be made public (but reviewer, area chair, and senior area chair identities will remain anonymous). Camera-ready papers will be due in advance of the conference. Authors will have the opportunity to submit code together with their paper, as per the Code Submission Policy. Finally, authors will be allowed to make minor changes, such as fixing typos or adding references, for a short period of time after the conference.\r\n\r\nToronto Paper Matching System and OpenReview: NeurIPS uses the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) and OpenReview in order to assign submissions to reviewers and area chairs. During the submission process, you will be asked to agree to the use of these systems for your submission.\r\n\r\nCompetitions, Demonstrations, Tutorials, and Workshops: There are separate tutorial, workshop, competition, and demonstration tracks at NeurIPS 2020. Authors who wish to submit to these tracks should consult the appropriate calls for submission.\r\n \r\nFrequently asked questions can be found here.\r\n\r\nHsuan-Tien Lin, Maria-Florina Balcan, Raia Hadsell, Marc\'Aurelio Ranzato\r\nNeurIPS 2020 Program Chairs\r\n\r\nHugo Larochelle\r\nNeurIPS 2020 General Chair', '2020-05-05 12:06:28.213572', '0', '0', 'A', ' ', 'a1', ' ', '', 'https://nips.cc/Conferences/2020', ' ');

Computer scientists and roboticists are researching graphics-based and physical social agents. Psychologists and neuroscientists are using these artifacts in laboratory experiments in order to study our interaction with them as well as to use them as confederates in the study of human behavior. Companies are actively developing similar technologies. However, these communities too rarely interact even though there are close synergies between psychology, the study of human behavior, and artificial social agents, the engineering of human behavior. The design of an artificial social agent involves the formalization of theories and data about human behavior, integration of resulting models into an agent and evaluation of its behavior, leveraging techniques derived from psychology. Each of these steps can in return be of fundamental value to psychological research. For example, formalization and integration forces one to concretely specify theoretical constructs and thereby expose hidden assumptions and gaps in theories. IVA 2020’s Special Topic provides an invitation to researchers and developers across disciplines to share their work on the challenges and uses of social agent research, in the hope to further trans-disciplinary collaboration.', '2020-05-05 12:06:29.561743', '0', '0', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '', 'https://iva2020.psy.gla.ac.uk/', ' ');

The IoT is about to enable a range of new capabilities and services far beyond today’s offerings. It will fundamentally change how people go about their lives. According to Gartner, the number of objects connected to the Internet is set to reach 20 billion by 2020. Cisco estimates the number will be close to 26 billion objects by 2020. Others believe the actual number will be even higher with the assumption that any object with a simple micro controller and on-off switch will be connected to the Internet in the near feature. The scale of the IoT is set to have a major economic, social and environmental impacts; the intersection of which forms the future sustainable growth. The IEEE Internet of Things: Systems, Management and Security (IoTSMS 2020) aims at soliciting original ideas on the broad area of IoT including challenges and opportunities, concepts and applications and future trends. The IoTSMS aims to facilitate discussions among academics and IoT practitioners and make positive contributions to the field. Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished manuscripts.

Specifically, authors are required to adhere to the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism and the ACM Policy on Prior Publication and Simultaneous Submissions.\r\n\r\nLike other conferences and journals, ICN prohibits violation of the above ACM Policies and may take action against authors who violate them. In some cases, the program committee may share information about submitted papers with other conference chairs and journal editors to ensure the compliance of papers under consideration. If the TPC discovers a violation of these principles, sanctions may include, but are not limited to, contacting the institutions of the authors and publicizing the details of the case.\r\n\r\nICN will review extended versions of previously-published short preliminary papers (such as workshop papers) in accordance with published ACM SIGCOMM policies. Papers accompanied by nondisclosure agreement requests will not be considered.\r\n\r\nPapers must be written in English. All submitted papers will be judged based on their quality and relevance through a single-blind reviewing process. Authors must identify themselves by name and affiliation in the title of the paper.\r\n\r\nConflicts of interest\r\n\r\nBoth authors and TPC members must identify conflicts of interest according to the following general principles.\r\n\r\nA program committee member (including the chairs of the committee) is considered to have a conflict of interest on a submission that has an author in any of the following categories: the person himself or herself; a past or current student or academic advisor; a supervisor or employee in the same line of authority within the past four years; a member of the same organization (e.g., company, university, government agency, etc.) within the past four years or in the near future (six months); a co-author of a paper appearing in publication within the past four years; someone with whom there has been a financial relationship (e.g., grants, contracts, consultancies, equity investments, stock options, etc.) within the past four years; someone with whom acceptance or rejection would further the personal goals of the reviewer (e.g., a competitor); a member of the same family or anyone considered a close personal friend; or someone about whom, for whatever reason, their work cannot be evaluated objectively. If there is no basis for the TPC conflicts provided by authors, however, those conflicts will be removed. Do not improperly indicate conflicts simply to prevent some TPC members from reviewing your paper.', '2020-05-05 12:06:30.734022', '0', '0', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '', 'http://conferences.sigcomm.org/acm-icn/2020/', ' ');

All submitted papers must comply with the double-blind submission requirements.\r\n\r\nScope of the Conference\r\n\r\nThe IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS) is the premier conference in the field of real-time systems, and is a venue for researchers and practitioners to showcase innovations covering all aspects of real-time systems, including theory, design, analysis, implementation, evaluation, and experience. RTSS’20, celebrating the 41st anniversary of the event, continues the trend of making RTSS an expansive and inclusive event, striving to embrace new and emerging areas of real-time systems research.\r\n\r\nRTSS’20 welcomes submissions of high-quality, original research papers related to both real-time system theory and practice. Submissions can go to either the real-time system track (Track 1) or the design and application track (Track 2) which covers Cyber-Physical Systems, HW-SW integration and system-level design, and Internet of Things (IoT). Details of the tracks can be found below. To be in scope, ALL submissions must address some form of real-time requirements such as deadlines, response times or delays/latency.\r\n\r\nRTSS’20 especially welcomes new and emerging topics provided that they address some aspects of real-time requirements as stated above. Such topics may include machine learning techniques for design and analysis of real-time systems, system design approaches for achieving real-time machine learning, resource management in autonomous systems, system-level solutions for real-time applications exploiting domain-specific accelerators, etc.\r\n\r\nAll accepted papers will appear in the main program and proceedings. A selection of papers will receive recognition as outstanding papers, and will be highlighted as such in the proceedings. Authors of outstanding papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their work to a special issue of a journal. Best paper and best student paper awards will be presented at the conference, along with an award for the best presentation. (Note that submissions are eligible for the best student paper award provided that the first author is a student as of the submission deadline).\r\n\r\nTrack 1: Real-Time System Track\r\n\r\nThe objective of this track is to promote cutting-edge research in real-time systems, especially new and emerging topics. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to the following: operating systems, networks, middleware, compilers, tools, scheduling, QoS support, resource management, testing and debugging, design and verification, modeling, WCET analysis, performance analysis, fault tolerance, security, and system experimentation and deployment experiences.\r\n\r\nTrack 2: Design and Application Track\r\n\r\nThis track aims to highlight the newest research achievements in designs, implementations and applications that must attend to some aspects of real-time requirements.  Continuing with the success in previous years, the track will particularly focus on three specialized areas:\r\n\r\nCyber-Physical Systems\r\n\r\nMany applications in the CPS domain (such as transportation, healthcare, industrial control, etc.) possess real-time requirements. Papers are welcomed that identify scientific foundations and technologies that advance the state-of-the-art for CPS.

A crucial milestone for taking full advantage of this potential is the endowment of algorithms that learn from experience with the ability to consult existing knowledge and reason with what has already been learned. Integrating learning and reasoning constitutes one of the key open questions in AI, and holds the potential of addressing many of the shortcomings of contemporary AI approaches, including the black-box nature and the brittleness of deep learning, and the difficulty to adapt knowledge representation models in the light of new data. Integrating learning and reasoning calls for approaches that combine knowledge representation and machine reasoning techniques with learning algorithms from the fields of neural, statistical and relational learning.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, four international conferences and workshops addressing such research topics join forces in the 1st International Conference on Learning & Reasoning (IJCLR):\r\n\r\n    The 30th International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming (ILP).\r\n    The ILP conference series has been the premier forum for work on logic-based approaches to learning for three decades. Originally focusing on the induction of logic programs, over the years it has expanded its research horizon to other forms of relational learning and to probabilistic approaches.\r\n    The 15th International Workshop on Neural-Symbolic Learning & Reasoning (NeSy).\r\n    The NeSy workshop series is a major venue for the presentation and discussion of key topics related to neural-symbolic computing, i.e. combinations of neural and logic-based approaches to learning & reasoning.\r\n    The 10th International Workshop on Statistical Relational Artificial Inteligence (StarAI).\r\n    The StarAI workshop series studies combinations of logic with probability theory and focuses on statistical inference and learning with relational and first-order logical representations.\r\n    The 10th International Workshop on Approaches and Applications of Inductive Programming (AAIP).\r\n    The AAIP workshop series focuses on learning executable programs in arbitrary programming languages, from incomplete specifications. e.g. from examples of their input/output behaviour.\r\n\r\nIJCLR 2020 aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners working on various aspects of learning & reasoning, via presentation of cutting-edge research on topics of special interest to the participating conferences/workshops.

ICMI is the premier international forum for multidisciplinary research on multimodal human-human and human-computer interaction, interfaces, and system development. The conference focuses on theoretical and empirical foundations, component technologies, and combined multimodal processing techniques that define the field of multimodal interaction analysis, interface design, and system development.\r\n\r\nWe are keen to showcase novel input and output modalities and interactions to the ICMI community. ICMI 2020 will feature a single-track main conference which includes: keynote speakers, technical full and short papers (including oral and poster presentations), demonstrations, exhibits and doctoral spotlight papers. The conference will also feature workshops and grand challenges. The proceedings of ICMI 2020 will be published by ACM as part of their series of International Conference Proceedings and Digital Library.\r\n\r\nWe also want to welcome conference papers from behavioural and social sciences. These papers allow us to understand how technology can be used to increase our scientific knowledge and may focus less on presenting technical or algorithmic novelty. For this reason, the \"novelty\" criteria used during ICMI 2020 review will be based on two sub-criteria (i.e., scientific novelty and technical novelty as described below). Accepted papers at ICMI 2020 only need to be novel on one of these sub-criteria. In other words, a paper which is strong on scientific knowledge contribution but low on algorithmic novelty should be ranked similarly to a paper that is high on algorithmic novelty but low on knowledge discovery.\r\n\r\n    Scientific Novelty: Papers should bring some new knowledge to the scientific community. For example, discovering new behavioural markers that are predictive of mental health or how new behavioural patterns relate to children’s interactions during learning. It is the responsibility of the authors to perform a proper literature review and clearly discuss the novelty in the scientific discoveries made in their paper.\r\n    Technical Novelty: Papers reviewed with this sub-criterion should include novelty in their computational approach for recognizing, generating or modeling data. Examples include: novelty in the learning and prediction algorithms, in the neural architecture, or in the data representation. Novelty can also be associated to a new usage of an existing approach.\r\n\r\nPlease see the Submission Guidelines for Authors for detailed submission instructions.\r\n\r\nThis year\'s conference theme: In this information age, technological innovation is at the core of our lives and rapidly transforming and impacting the state of the world in art, culture, and society, and science as well - the borders between classical disciplines such as humanities and computer science are fading. In particular, we wonder how multimodal processing of human behavioural data can create meaningful impact in art, culture, and society practices. And vice versa, how does art, culture, and society influence our approaches and techniques in multimodal processing? As such, this year, ICMI welcomes contributions on our theme for Multimodal processing and representation of Human Behaviour in Art, Culture, and Society.\r\n\r\nAdditional topics of interest include but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n    Affective computing and interaction\r\n    Cognitive modeling and multimodal interaction\r\n    Gesture, touch and haptics\r\n    Healthcare, assistive technologies\r\n    Human communication dynamics\r\n    Human-robot/agent multimodal interaction\r\n    Interaction with smart environment\r\n    Machine learning for multimodal interaction\r\n    Mobile multimodal systems\r\n    Multimodal behaviour generation\r\n    Multimodal datasets and validation\r\n    Multimodal dialogue modeling\r\n    Multimodal fusion and representation\r\n    Multimodal interactive applications\r\n    Speech behaviours in social interaction\r\n    System components and multimodal platforms\r\n    Visual behaviours in social interaction\r\n    Virtual/augmented reality and multimodal interaction', '2020-05-05 12:06:32.906685', '0', '0', 'C', 'b', 'a2', ' ', '', 'http://icmi.acm.org/2020/', '延期');

Key Theme\r\n\r\nThe primary objective of IEEE-iSES (formerly IEEE-iNIS) is to provide a platform for both hardware and software researchers to interact under one umbrella for further development of smart electronic systems. Efficient and secure data sensing, storage, and processing play pivotal roles in current information age. The state-of-the-art smart electronic systems cater to the needs of efficient sensing, storage, and computing. At the same time, efficient algorithms and software used for faster analysis and retrieval of desired information are becoming increasingly important. Big data which are large, complex data sets, are now a part of the Internet world. Storing and processing needs of the enormous amount of structured and unstructured data are getting increasingly challenging. At the same time, Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical systems (CPS) have been evolving with simultaneous development of hardware and software and span across everyday consumer electronics. The performance and efficiency of the present as well as the future generations of computing and information processing systems are largely dependent upon advances in both hardware and software. IEEE-iSES has been initiated as a sponsored meeting of Technical Committee on VLSI, IEEE-CS (http://www.ieee-tcvlsi.org/) that endorses a league of successful meetings including ASAP, ISVLSI, and ARITH, are now presented as “Sister Conferences”.\r\n\r\n2. Different Tracks\r\n\r\n1) Nanoelectronic VLSI and Sensor Systems (NVS)\r\n\r\nDifferent revolutionary and evolutionary technologies in nanoscale have evolved to cater to the need of future generation computing and information processing. Some of the thrust areas in this domain include: (a) Nanotechnologies, nanowire, nanotubes and nano-sensors, (b) Molecular electronics, bio-sensors, bio-molecular and biologically-inspired computing, (c) Nanoelectronics for energy harvesting, (d) Spintronics, domain-wall, and phase-change memories, (e) Memristor and memristive systems, (f) Advanced 3D IC technologies, design techniques, and 3D packaging, (g) On-chip interconnection network design, modeling, and simulation, (h) GPU, HPC, and large-scale cloud-based computing, (i) Quantum computing, communication, and information processing, (j) Application specific circuit, system, and sensor design using nanoelectronics, (k) Chip to System design for critical applications, (l) Electronic design automation (EDA) or computer-aided design (CAD) methods covering these areas.\r\n\r\n2) Energy-Efficient, Reliable VLSI Systems (ERS)\r\n\r\nConsumption of energy or power dissipation has become a major issue in today’s nanoelectronic and information processing systems. Researchers are trying to address and overcome this critical bottleneck in different ways. Some of the major thrust areas are as follows: (a) Energy efficient hardware-software design and co-synthesis, (b) Energy efficient applications using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), (c) Sustainability of energy efficient applications, (d) Dynamic power management, (e) Modeling, simulation, and validation, (f) Energy generation, recovery, and management systems, (g) Reliability analysis, modeling, and reliable system design, h) Low-power wearable and implantable systems, (i) Multi-core systems, Network-on-Chip, and MPSoCs, (j) Reversible Circuits and Systems, (k) Reconfigurable Systems, (l) Microfluidics and Biochips, (m) Electronic design automation (EDA) or computer-aided design (CAD) methods covering these areas.\r\n\r\n3) Hardware/Software for Internet of Things and Consumer Electronics (IoT)\r\n\r\nIoT envisions the development of tools, techniques, and standards to make ‘things’ more intelligent and programmable to develop more capable ‘things’ to address the necessity of human beings. It covers all types of sensors, communication protocols, computational tools, techniques, devices, processors, embedded systems, data warehousing, big data, cloud computing, server farms, grid computing etc. Topics of interests include the followings: (a) IoT architecture, (b) IoT enabling technologies, services, and applications, (c) IoT system integration, management, and standards, (d) IoT big data analytics, (e) IoT security and privacy concerns, (f) IoT at nanoscale, (g) Emerging hardware/software solutions for IoT, (h) Hardware and software solutions for smart cities, (i) IoT applications in areas of healthcare, agriculture, transport, waste management, (j) Hardware and software based systems for aerotropolis, (k) emerging nanoelectronics for smart consumer electronics covering these areas.\r\n\r\n4) Hardware for Secure Information Processing (SIP)\r\n\r\nDue to ever increasing demand of network and information contents, hardware capacity for storage, analytics, and processing are catching the eyes of researchers to provide efficient solution to the above. Some of the thrust areas are as follows: (a) Circuits and systems for digital rights management (DRM), watermarking, and encryption, (b) Data protection strategies and controls, (c) Mobile security and bring your own device (BYOD), (d) Medical device security, (e) Cyber security, (f) Emerging embedded solutions for security covering these areas.\r\n\r\n5) Hardware/Software Solutions for Big Data (SBD)\r\n\r\nLarge, complex data sets that are difficult to process using traditional data processing tools and often do not fit within the available on-board memory are traditionally called big data. Big Data presents multiple challenges including privacy, analysis, search, storage, transfer, and visualization.

We are not responsible for their content.).\r\n\r\nAs with previous editions, ACI2020 is in co-operation with ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) and SIGCHI (Special interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction) and accepted contributions will be published in the ACM Digital Library within the ACI2020 Proceedings Volume.\r\n\r\nConference theme\r\n\r\nThis year\'s conferene theme is Embodied Dialogues. On the one hand, the theme implicitly refers to the challenges and opportunities that arise when designing and developing interactive technology for and with users and participants who do not communicate through what we term \'natural language\', which makes supporting embodied exchanges all the more important. On the other hand, the theme alludes to the possibilities open by technologies such as the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence, thanks to which computing applications are increasingly embedded into the infrastructures and objects of the physical environment in which multispecies agents operate and interact. Although specifically focussed, the theme is very broad in the connections that can be made from multiple angles, in order to encourage engagement with and contributions to the conference from a wide range of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary perspectives. Submissions that relate to this year\'s conference theme are especially welcome, but high quality submissions are welcome regardless.\r\n\r\nContribution areas\r\n\r\nRelevant contribution areas might include: \r\n\r\n    Design: for example, interaction modalities that may need to be developed in order to make technology accessible to other animals; novel designs for users with different sensorial apparatuses, cognitive capabilities, and ergonomic characteristics; multisensory interfaces and alternative interactional paradigms appropriate for ACI; design solutions developed within ACI applications that could inform design within interaction design or animal studies \r\n    Methodology: for example, methodological frameworks enabling animals to actively participate in the design process as legitimate stakeholders, contributors and users; multidisciplinary methodologies that can be called upon when designing with animals or investigating how technology affects them and their interactions with humans; methodologies that can be derived from other disciplines; more-than-human approaches developed within ACI that could contribute to other disciplines \r\n    Theory: for example, main challenges that ACI researchers may encounter in conceptualizing the interaction between humans, animals and technology; ways of interpreting the outcomes of applied studies, concrete designs and research practices to articulate such interactions; existing theoretical frameworks from other disciplines, that ACI theories can draw from or contribute to \r\n    Ethics: for example, legitimate technological applications for ACI; implications of ACI’s animal-centered perspective for conducting research that involves animal participants; ethical frameworks that may or may not be suitable to support the development of ACI; relation between ethics and methodology in ACI; potential influence of ACI ethics on ethical aspects of HCI research \r\n    Applications: for example, ACI applications relating to animal studies or husbandry, or practices involving animals in a range of contexts; applications that mediate the interaction between humans and other animals, or interactions among other animals; animal technologies that do or do not constitute good examples of or models for ACI. \r\n\r\nAssessment criteria \r\n\r\nRegardless of whether they relate to this year\'s conference theme, all submissions will be assessed based on the following criteria: \r\n\r\n    Contribution to the field. The submission should make a novel and significant contribution to the field of ACI, proportionate to the category of submission (e.g. full papers should make a more substantial contribution compared to extended abstracts associated with video-posters). \r\n    Quality of the submission. The submission should be of high quality, both with regards to its content (e.g., the work presented should be well motivated in relation to existing issues and related work; approaches and methodologies should be appropriately chosen and rigorously implemented; the significance of research findings should be properly discussed; arguments should be carefully constructed and claims adequately supported) and with regards to its presentation (e.g., the submission’s structure should be appropriate to the type of contribution; the work should be described clearly; the use of language should be correct; terminology should be accessible to non-specialists or any specialist terminology should be explained). \r\n    Transparency of the approach. The submission should clearly express how the process of thinking about and conducting the presented work relates to ACI’s animal-centred perspective. This includes design, methodological and ethical considerations. In particular, each submission should include an explanation of how animals have been involved or represented, or their role and perspective have been accounted for, in the work and, if applicable, what ethical perspective or frameworks have been applied.', '2020-05-05 12:06:33.171523', '0', '0', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '', 'http://www.aciconf.org/aci2020', ' ');

It provides an international forum for presentation of original research results, as well as exchange and dissemination of innovative and practical development experiences. The conference covers all aspects of data mining, including algorithms, software, systems, and applications. ICDM draws researchers, application developers, and practitioners from a wide range of data mining related areas such as big data, deep learning, pattern recognition, statistical and machine learning, databases, data warehousing, data visualization, knowledge-based systems, and high-performance computing. By promoting novel, high-quality research findings, and innovative solutions to challenging data mining problems, the conference seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in data mining.\r\n\r\nTopics of Interest\r\n\r\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n·        Foundations, algorithms, models and theory of data mining, including big data mining.\r\n·        Deep learning and statistical methods for data mining.\r\n·        Mining from heterogeneous data sources, including text, semi-structured, spatio-temporal, streaming, graph, web, and multimedia data.\r\n·        Data mining systems and platforms, and their efficiency, scalability, security and privacy.\r\n·        Data mining for modelling, visualization, personalization, and recommendation.\r\n·        Data mining for cyber-physical systems and complex, time-evolving networks.\r\n·        Applications of data mining in social sciences, physical sciences, engineering, life sciences, web, marketing, finance, precision medicine, health informatics, and other domains.\r\n\r\nWe particularly encourage submissions in emerging topics of high importance such as ethical data analytics, automated data analytics, data-driven reasoning, interpretable modeling, modeling with evolving environment, cyber-physical systems, multi-modality data mining, and heterogeneous data integration and mining.\r\n\r\nSubmission Guidelines\r\n\r\nPaper submissions should be limited to a maximum of ten (10) pages, in the IEEE 2-column format, including the bibliography and any possible appendices. Submissions longer than 10 pages will be rejected without review. All submissions will be triple-blind reviewed by the Program Committee on the basis of technical quality, relevance to scope of the conference, originality, significance, and clarity. The following sections give further information for authors.\r\n\r\nTriple Blind Submission Guidelines\r\n\r\nSince 2011, ICDM has imposed a triple blind submission and review policy for all submissions. Authors must hence not use identifying information in the text of the paper and bibliographies must be referenced to preserve anonymity. Any papers available on the Web (including Arxiv) no longer qualify for ICDM submissions, as their author information is already public.\r\n\r\nWhat is Triple Blind Reviewing?\r\n\r\nThe traditional blind paper submission hides the referee names from the authors, and the double-blind paper submission also hides the author names from the referees. The triple-blind reviewing further hides the referee names among referees during paper discussions before their acceptance decisions. The names of authors and referees remain known only to the PC Co-chairs, and the author names are disclosed only after the ranking and acceptance of submissions are finalized. It is imperative that all authors of ICDM submissions conceal their identity and affiliation information in their paper submissions. It does not suffice to simply remove the author names and affiliations from the first page, but also in the content of each paper submission.\r\n\r\nAll deadlines are at 11:59PM Pacific Daylight Time.\r\n\r\nWorkshop proposals: March 2, 2020\r\nWorkshop notification: March 30, 2020\r\nFull paper submissions: June 11, 2020\r\nContest requirement specification and sample data available: June 12, 2020\r\nContest team registration begins.

Engaging multiple and new roles, including communities and individual patients in their own integrated healthcare services delivery is one of the promising opportunities which can be made possible by the microservices structuring of the health and care system . Broadly speaking, related discovery, composition and provision of healthcare services will need to be based on cutting-edge computer technologies and digital media/data so that quality factors including timing, granularity, scale, cost-effectiveness, safety, security, privacy, and precision are integral parts of the healthcare value chain ecosystem. Digital Health services can include, among many other innovative methods, preventive and predictive capabilities of machine learning based data analytics, actionable recommendations based on in-situ monitoring and assessment of an individual’s real-time physical and cognitive performance, trade-off analysis between cloud-based versus edge-based sensory data streaming and data analytics.\r\n\r\nDHAASS will embrace a broad spectrum of issues and concerns, including, but not limited to, the following topics related to digital health as services:\r\n\r\n    Microservices models and architectures of health and integrated care services\r\n    Disease/condition-specific provider microservice design (e.g., diabetes, obesity, COPD, dementia, post cancer treatment, allergies, Ear, Nose and Throat Conditions (ENT))\r\n    Patient/user-side microservices design (user needs, social isolation, assistive living for older adults and individuals with special needs, emergencies)\r\n    Standardizing provider-side and user-side microservices.

For example, while agile development pleads against development for reuse, agile teams increasingly rely on ecosystems of (re)usable open source software developed by quintessential reuse organizations—open source developer communities. Similarly, cloud computing and container technologies have revolutionized software architectures reuse at the architectural level—now embodied as reusable services on cloud platforms. These are but two examples about how recent advances in software engineering have had important—and sometimes contradictory—effects on reuse.\r\n\r\nWe invite submissions on new and innovative research results and industrial experience reports dealing with all aspects of software reuse within the context of the modern software development landscape, characterized by:\r\n\r\n    Large ecosystems of reusable, open-source components and service-oriented, containerized cloud-hosted applications,\r\n    Context-aware (IoT) applications, which combine a complex and heterogeneous mix of ever more powerful hardware and evolving software frameworks and containers,\r\n    The resurgence of AI as both, (i) an enabling technology for reuse for domain engineering (e.g. domain ontologies, identification of reusable assets) and application engineering (e.g. component retrieval), and (ii) an object of reuse that addresses the full lifecycle and scope of “intelligent” software components, i.e. well beyond the simple (re)use of machine learning libraries.\r\n\r\nTopics of interest include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n    Reuse organizational, managerial, economic, and legal issues, in general, and as they pertain to the new development landscape (wide-spread open-source libraries, IoT, AI):\r\n        Economic models of reuse\r\n        Benefit and risk analysis, scoping\r\n        Legal and managerial aspects of reuse\r\n        Reuse adoption and transition to software reuse\r\n        Lightweight reuse approaches\r\n        Reuse in agile projects\r\n    Technical aspects of reuse, including:\r\n        Domain analysis\r\n        Domain ontologies and models\r\n        Variability management and software product lines\r\n        Feature modeling reuse practices\r\n        Domain specific languages (DSLs)\r\n        New language abstractions for software reuse\r\n        Generative Development\r\n        Ontology and Model-Driven Development\r\n        Identification of reusable assets in legacy systems\r\n        COTS-based development and reuse of open source assets\r\n        Retrieval and recommendation of reusable assets\r\n        Reuse of non-code artifacts\r\n        Configuration and release management with COTS\r\n        Architecture-centric reuse approaches\r\n        Service-oriented architectures and microservices\r\n        Software composition and modularization \r\n    Software reuse in industry\r\n        Reuse success stories\r\n        Reuse failures, and lessons learned\r\n        Reuse obstacles and success factors\r\n        ROI studies \r\n\r\nAs with previous editions, accepted papers will appear in the conference proceedings, to be published by Springer-Verlag’s Lecture Notes in Computer Science, and will be searchable through the main online indices.\r\n\r\nThe program committee will award a Best Paper Award to the best paper in terms of:\r\n\r\n    originality,\r\n    presentation,\r\n    impact. \r\n\r\nThe finalists will be submitted to a special issue of a refereed journal.

It aims to provide a forum for scholars and practitioners to share their knowledge and experience in engineering and technology education, as well as in technology-enabled educational innovation across a variety of academic and professional disciplines. The target audience of the conference is diverse and includes those working in the higher education, vocational education and training (VET), K-12, corporate, government and healthcare sectors.\r\n\r\nThe theme of this year’s conference is “Embarking on a new era of learning with transformative technologies.”\r\n\r\nThe conference theme challenges us to look anew at how the potential of current and emerging technologies can and/or should be harnessed for education and learning in our ever-changing world. Over the last several decades, digital technologies have revolutionized the way we work, play and learn—arguably changing our lives for the better overall—but they have not come without their problems and challenges (e.g., environmental degradation, social inequity arising from the “digital divide,” ethical and moral dilemmas brought about by artificial intelligence). Over the next ten years (2020–2029), technologies such as AI, robotics, brain–computer interfaces, and extended or cross-reality (XR) that augment human sensory abilities, cognition and performance will continue to evolve and have a transformative impact. How can we ensure this transformation is positive, both for and through learning? As these technologies increasingly blur the boundaries between human and machine, and between physical and virtual, what can we do so the technology works toward our advantage, for the betterment of all of society and of our planet? Participants of TALE 2020 are encouraged to engage with these and other questions from creative, multidimensional and interdisciplinary perspectives as we stand on the precipice of this new era of learning with transformative technologies.\r\n\r\nCORE TRACKS\r\n\r\n    Engineering Education (University/College)\r\n    Computing & IT Education (University/College)\r\n    STEM Education (K-12)\r\n    Technology-Enhanced Learning\r\n    Open, Flexible & Distance Learning\r\n    Workplace & Industry-Based Learning\r\n\r\nSPECIAL TRACKS (Tentative)\r\n\r\n    XR and Immersive Learning Environments\r\n    Organized in conjunction with the Immersive Learning Research Network (iLRN)\r\n    Big Data, Analytics and Machine Learning in Education\r\n    Preparing the workforce for Industry 4.0: Robotics, automation, and ubiquitous smart technologies in education \r\n\r\nTOPICS\r\n\r\nTopics of interest include but are not limited to the following:\r\n• Academic Staff/Faculty Development\r\n• Accreditation and Quality Assurance\r\n• Active Learning Spaces\r\n• Artificial Intelligence in Education\r\n• Assessment and Evaluation\r\n• Blockchain in Education\r\n• Capstone Projects and Project-Based Learning\r\n• Computer-Based Learning and Courseware Technologies\r\n• Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning\r\n• Continuing Education and Lifelong Learning\r\n• Curriculum Design\r\n• Distance, Open and Flexible Education\r\n• Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics\r\n• Educational Games and Simulations\r\n• Educational Policy, Leadership and Administration\r\n• Entrepreneurship Programs\r\n• Ethical, Legal and Social Justice Issues (e.g., Access, Equity)\r\n• Gender and Diversity\r\n• Generic Skills (e.g., Communications, Teamwork)\r\n• Human–Machine Collaborative Learning\r\n• Industry Linkages and Partnerships\r\n• Instructional and Learning Design\r\n• Intelligent Tutoring Systems\r\n• Introductory Engineering and Computing Courses\r\n• Just-in-Time Learning and Job Performance Support\r\n• K–12 Initiatives and Partnerships\r\n• Laboratory Experiences (On-Campus and Remote)\r\n• Learning Management Systems\r\n• Learning Technology Standards and Standardization\r\n• Marketing and Outreach for Engineering and Computing Programs\r\n• Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)\r\n• Microcredentialing and Badges\r\n• Online/E-Learning and Blended Learning\r\n• Open Educational Resources (OER)\r\n• Personal Data and Security in Education\r\n• Research Training (Undergraduate and Postgraduate)\r\n• Robotics in Education\r\n• Service Learning and Experiential Learning\r\n• STE(A)M education in K-12 or higher education\r\n• Technology Infrastructure for Supporting Next-Generation Learning (e.g., 5G, Cloud Computing, Internet of Things)\r\n• Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality Learning Environments\r\n• Wearable, Mobile and Ubiquitous Learning\r\n• Work-Based and Work-Integrated Learning', '2020-05-05 12:06:35.228256', '0', '0', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '', 'http://tale2020.org/', '延期');

Nevertheless the classical simulation approach would be used to introduce students to the area of simulation Event World View, Process World View or Activity World View, there is a permanent difficulty to focus on the basics of simulation, to focus on the foundations of simulation. In fact, in most cases, the need for some background on computer programming will tend to neglect those matters and concentrate on syntax details of some programming language rather than on a full comprehension of simulation basic concepts. This track is then intended to concentrate on new developments as far as simulation modeling techniques is concerned, including the use of graphical approaches to simulation modeling and also to the automatic generation of simulation programs. Contributions based on Event Scheduling approaches, Activity Cycle Diagrams approach or Process Flow approaches are most welcome. Contributions related to educational concerns but also contributions related to industrial applications are encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe following topic areas within this track on Discrete Simulation Modeling Techniques and Tools (although this list should not be treated as exclusive), will be object of interest:\r\n\r\n    Discrete Event Simulation\r\n    Event Scheduling\r\n    Activity Cycle Diagrams\r\n    Process Flow\r\n    Visual Modeling Tools\r\n    Visualization and Animation Tools\r\n    Business Process Modeling\r\n    Simulation Methodology\r\n    Simulation Education\r\n    Simulation Industrial Applications\r\n    Flowchart Simulation\r\n    Automatic Generation of Simulation Programs\r\n    Customization of Software for Discrete Event Simulation\r\n\r\nQueueing Models\r\n\r\nQueueing phenomona are omnipresent, for example work in progress waiting at a workstation, vehicles in traffic jams, and packets waiting to be transmitted.

The focus of Agent Based Simulation is on simulating and organization social behaviours in order to understand real social systems via the development and testing of new concepts.\r\n\r\nThe following topic areas (although this list should not be treated as exclusive), will be object of interest:\r\n\r\n    Agent-based simulation techniques and methodologies\r\n    Agent Architectures, Model Specification and Languages\r\n    Decision making and Strategies\r\n    Game Theory and Fuzzy logic for agent-based modeling\r\n    Discrete-event simulation in Multi-Agent Systems\r\n    Multi-Level Simulation and Emergence\r\n    Simulation toolkits and frameworks\r\n    Applications in Ecology and Environment, Psychology, Cognitive Science and AI, Economics and Market Systems, Business Process Management, Industry, Manufacturing and Logistics and Transport and Healthcare with the emphasis on simulation and modeling\r\n    Agent-based modeling (ABM) within geographical systems\r\n\r\nThe aim of this track is to allow the debate on emerging issues, gathering the scientific community researching in these areas. This workshop is a forum for discussion and presentation of new contributions on Agent-based simulation\r\n\r\nThus, it is intended: to identify the critical points of the use of Agent-based simulation as well as processes and the areas where is needed an urgent action; to present and discuss new approaches, trends and innovative aspects of the Agent-based simulation; to promote the use of Agent-based simulation and to explore ways to overcome resistance to change; to analyze the level of use of Agent-based simulation in Europe and to compare with the world situation.\r\n\r\nWith this track it is expected that the scientific community gets some directions from what has been done and what can be done by motivating the researching and the search for new solutions in the area of Agent Based Simulation\r\n\r\nSimulation and Optimization\r\n\r\nThe aim of this track is to provide a forum for high quality research on simulation and optimization problems. Plenty of hard problems in a huge variety of areas, including logistics, network design, bioinformatics, engineering, business, etc., have been tackled successfully with simulation and optimization approaches. An entire decade passed from the promissory initial contribution for the Wedding Optimization and Simulation and it will be an important opportunity to perform an overview over the past and discuss the new trends to the future.\r\n\r\nSimulation optimization is a promising field of research, used in practical simulation applications and being incorporated into simulation software tools. This track is a forum for discussion and presentation of new contributions and also an overview of simulation optimization, but with an emphasis on problems with discrete decision variables.\r\n\r\nThe Simulation and Optimization track at ESM invites original and unpublished contributions in any topic concerning applications of simulation for all kinds of optimization problems. See the list of suggested (but not limited to) topics at:\r\n\r\n    Applications of simulation to optimization problems\r\n    Theoretical developments in simulation and optimization\r\n    Neighbourhoods and efficient searching algorithms\r\n    Variation operators for stochastic search methods\r\n    Insight into problem characteristics of problem classes\r\n    Comparisons between different (also exact) techniques\r\n    Incorporation of optimization Packages / Toolkits / Toolboxes in Simulation Software\r\n    Commercial software packages\r\n\r\nIoT and Smart Industry\" (Internet of Things & Industry 4.0)\r\n\r\nThe use of Smart-IoT in different domains (Smart Manufacturing Systems, eHealth, smart-agriculture, etc.), imposes new challenges in design and verification of such embedded systems. These smart-components are often software dominated. The optimization and deployment of the software part become a complex task. In addition, and for performance purpose, the need to implement certain functions as hardware accelerators (IP : Intellectual Proprieties) is highly recommended. To choose the trade-off between the best mapping schemes a deep DSE (Design Space Exploration) is needed. To tackle this complexity, there is an urgent need to review co-design flow and related performance evaluation and optimisation techniques. On the other hand, due to the heterogeneity of these components and their interdependencies, it is urgent to find a simple way for fast IoT-generation that guaranty interoperability and reconfiguration. The aim of this track is to expose recent works on issues related to design, monitoring and verification of embedded systems used in IoT and smart-manufacturing, developing and using models for performance, security and safety purposes.\r\n\r\nHigh Performance and Large Scale Computing\r\n\r\nThis track invites contributions on efficient Modelling and Simulation Algorithms and Computer-intensive Simulation Projects on High-performance Large Scale Computers and Distributed Platforms. Methods and techniques for parallel simulation (scheduling, synchronisation, load balancing), Performance of parallel and distributed simulation (experimental and comparative studies, performance models, benchmarks), High Level Architecture (HLA) and related standards (time management, model semantics, implementation issues), High Performance and Large Scale Systems for Computational Science (biological, chemical, physical, etc.) Application of parallel and distributed simulation (computer systems, manufacturing systems, etc.), Parallelisation of simulations (numerical methods, (Quasi-Monte-Carlo simulation), Simulation in Cluster, Multicluster, and Grid Computing, Simulation in Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (wireless, mobile, wearable, invisible), Parallel Processing with Games Machines, Exaflop Computing.\r\n\r\nSimulation in Education and Graphics/Data Visualization Simulation\r\n\r\nThis track covers; Simulation and e-learning, - Role Strategies) Management Games, Simulation with \"man in the loop\", Virtual Reality Systems, Realistic Presentation of Simulation, Results, Simulation for Training and Education, Web-based Simulation, Multi-site Group Simulation, Special Purpose Simulation Languages and Tools, Simulation Environments, Simulator Development Environments, Visual Modelling Tools, Multimedia, Visualization and Animation Tools, Interfaces for Coupling with External Tools, Data Models Visualization. Visualization algorithms and techniques, Volume visualization, Information visualization, Multiresolution methods, Modelling techniques and Interaction techniques and architectures\r\n\r\nSimulation in Environment, Ecology and Marine Biology\r\n\r\nThe main goal is to enhance the trans-disciplinarity and to facilitate contacts and dialogs between computer scientists and specialists of Environmental Sciences. Since 10 years the modelling process took benefits from recent (and less recent) techniques of computer science : Object-Oriented Languages, Discrete Event Simulation, Concepts of Agent and Actor, Fuzzy Logic, UML, model - GIS interface, Web-based simulation, environment management, predictive models of forest growth, fishing, climate and other biological processes. Papers dealing with ecological modelling (in a wider sense) are welcome in the areas of: Applications: Environment managing, Waste managing, Ecosystem dynamics (terrestrial and oceanographic ecology) Population dynamics (diseases & epidemics, changes in biodiversity, genome, predator-prey relationships, fishing...), Population behaviour, Individual behaviour, involving methodologies such as: Artificial Intelligence, Distributed Interactive Simulation, High-Performance Computing, Languages, Modelling Techniques, Simulation Methodologies & Tools, Synthetic Environment, Virtual Reality, Petri nets, DEVS and Bond Graphs. Modelling and simulation have an important role in structuring biological, medical and ecological systems. The intrinsic complexity and non-linearity of these types of systems need continuous and discrete simulation methodology, soft computing methodology in order to handle the different degrees of uncertainty, as well as virtual reality methodology describing the time and space dependent complexity.

The purpose of the conference is to provide an opportunity for the leading academic scientists, researchers, engineers, industrialists, scholars and other professionals from all over the world to interact and exchange their new ideas and research outcomes in related fields and develop possible chances for future collaboration. The conference is also aimed at motivating the next generation of researchers to promote their interests in machine learning and NLP.\r\n\r\nNLP technologies and digital resources such as lexical databases, ontologies and corpora are instrumental to millions of people who use them every day without even being aware of them. Systems like Google Translate and web search engines rely more and more on levels of linguistic information automatically provided through NLP tools, and on huge repositories of structured language data. This development has deeply affected the way we think about language from a scientific perspective. Linguists have progressively turned their focus from abstract properties of language to the dynamics of its usage in communicative contexts. There is increasing awareness that language digital repositories, technologies and computational models of language processes not only shed considerable light on traditional issues in language and literary studies but may also lead to a radical reconceptualization of them. Aspects of language acquisition, lexical access, speech recognition, text translation, text analysis, ontology extraction, reading and optical character recognition can be put to a rigorous empirical test through computer simulations. Likewise, corpora, lexical databases and ontologies have helped us focus on the nature of language data from a different perspective. From this standpoint, digital data and computer technologies provide an empirical middle ground where interdisciplinary insights can be empirically assessed and integrated.\r\n\r\nThis conference is therefore equally intended to explore and debate the contribution of computational language models and language data to a better understanding of linguistic, psycholinguistic, sociolinguistic, historical and literary issues of the language and culture.

The forum will focus, in particular, on issues as the development of innovative pedagogical models, appropriate training plans and adaptive digital tools to support learners and lead them to success.\r\n\r\nOver the past few years, there has been an exponential increase in the number of learners with learning disabilities and difficulties in their adaptation to the educational programs. Learning disabilities concern the acquisition, organization, retention, comprehension or processing of information. They mainly affect oral language (communication), written language (reading and writing) as well as mathematics (calculation, logical reasoning and problem solving). Several disorders or syndromes of neuropsychological origin can be at the origin of these learning disabilities such as “Dys” disorders (Dyslexia, dysgraphia, dysphasia, etc.), attention deficit (with or without hyperactivity), memory disorders, Asperger\'s syndrome, autism, etc.\r\nLearning disabilities can have a significant impact on the learner\'s life and his academic performance. The difficulties are even greater when the educational system adopts classical teaching methods which make the learning more complex.\r\nIn this particular learning landscape, technology may play a major role in supporting disabled learners. Indeed, several technology-based solutions are developed in order to compensate the inconveniences and adapt the educational practice. As example, we can cite assistive technology for learners which allows increasing learners’ autonomy, differentiated learning activities, communities of practice for generalizing good practices and pedagogical advice, etc. Several other fields are still to be explored like serious games, ambient intelligent systems, etc.\r\n\r\nTOPICS\r\n\r\nWe solicit submissions of original ideas and papers describing significant results and developments from both researchers and practitioners in a specific range of fields addressing the following topics :\r\n\r\n    E-Learning tools, systems, and applications\r\n    Adaptive learning systems\r\n    Serious games\r\n    Pedagogical models\r\n    Intelligent learning systems\r\n    Early identification of learning disabilities\r\n    Learning assessment and evaluation\r\n    Academic assessment and remediation\r\n    Technological infrastructure\r\n    Inclusive classroom environment\r\n    Open educational practices\r\n    Learning styles and learning strategies', '2020-05-05 12:06:35.991787', '0', '0', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '', 'http://www.ieee.ma/cist20/special-invited-sessions/led-ict', ' ');

Tumors, for example, undergo dynamic spatio-temporal changes, both during their progression and in response to therapies. Therefore, there is a pressing need to design and develop mathematical and computational strategies to harness cancer data in an accurate and efficient fashion. Advanced mathematical and computational models could provide the tools to make therapeutic strategies adaptable enough and to address the emerging targets. Similarly, understanding the interrelationship amongst complex biological processes requires analyzing very large databases of cellular pathways. High-performance computing, big data analytics, data-intensive computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and medical image analysis techniques could be critical in addressing these challenges.\r\n\r\nISMCO seeks papers describing contributions to the state of the art and practice in mathematical and computational oncology.

As always, the technological aspects evolve faster than the scientific community mentality. Transforming Big Data into Big Knowledge and developing a new kind of Knowledge-Based Systems require new visions and approaches. Companies, facing the Big Data challenges, are moving faster in the right direction than the scientific community, being under a stronger competitive pressure. They were forced to renounce to wishful thinking, like the idea that a few variables, embedded in a few rules, discovered using the old fashion statistics, will give intelligent support for business decisions. We have to do the same for developing various applications.\r\n\r\nMoreover, motivated by the big data analytics needs, new computing and storage technologies are developing rapidly and pushing for new high-end hardware geared toward big data problems. While the high-performance computing technologies have the potential to greatly improve the effectiveness of big data analytics, the cost and sophistications of those technology and limited initial application support often make them inaccessible to the end users and not fully utilized in academia years later. Meanwhile, comprehensive analytic software environment and platforms, such as R and Python, have become increasingly popular open-source platforms for data analysis.\r\n\r\nAlso, Computational Intelligence (CI) methodologies, tailored to Big Data, and combined with a proper vision of living systems, e.g., as complex dynamical systems or networks of interacting entities, could pave the way to Knowledge-Based System.\r\n\r\nTopics\r\n\r\nWe welcome contributions from the following fields:\r\n\r\n    Data Visualization and Visual Analytics\r\n    Natural Language Processing in Big Texts\r\n    Biomedical imaging pre‐processing and Analysis\r\n    Hardware and Software solutions for Big Data Searching, Storing and Management\r\n    Structured and Unstructured Data/Text/Web Mining\r\n    Deep Learning architecture, representations, unsupervised and supervised algorithms\r\n    Scalable computational intelligence tools\r\n    Novel Computational Intelligence approaches for data analysis\r\n    Evolutionary and Bio‐inspired approaches for Big Data analysis\r\n    New domains and novel applications related to Big Data technologies\r\n    Education Data Mining and Visualization\r\n    Educational Big Data and Learning Analysis\r\n    Artificial Intelligence in Education\r\n    Big Data and Intelligent Learning Environment\r\n    Deep Learning Application in Education\r\n\r\nPublication\r\n\r\nAll accepted and presented papers will be submitted for publishing by Springer and made available through SpringerLink Digital Library.\r\n\r\nPast volumes of BDTA proceedings are indexed in leading indexing services, including Ei Compendex, ISI Web of Science, Scopus, CrossRef, Google Scholar, DBLP, as well as EAI’s own EU Digital Library (EUDL).\r\n\r\nAuthors of selected best accepted and presented papers will be invited to submit an extended version to:\r\n\r\n    Mobile Networks and Applications (MONET) Journal (IF: 2.390)\r\n    EAI Endorsed Transactions on Scalable Information Systems\r\n\r\nGet published with EAI:\r\n\r\n    EAI Transactions (Open Access)\r\n    EAI/Springer Innovations in Communications and Computing Book Series', '2020-05-05 12:06:36.647386', '0', '0', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '', 'http://infoscale.org/', ' ');

With the help of the computational intelligence, these digital ecosystems can exhibit new self-* properties (such as self-management, self-healing and self-configuration) environments, thanks to the re-combination and evolution of its \"digital components\", in which resources provided by each entity are properly conserved, managed and used. The underlying web-based resources mainly comprehend big data management, innovative services, smart and self-* properties platforms. Due to the multi-disciplinary nature of digital ecosystems, they are highly complex to study and design. This also leads to a poor understanding as to how managing resources will empower digital ecosystems to be innovative, intelligent and value-creating. The application of Information Technologies has the potential to enable the understanding of how entities request resources and ultimately interact to create benefits and added-values, impacting business practices and knowledge. These technologies can be improved through novel techniques, models and methodologies for fields such as big data management, web technologies, networking, security, human-computer interactions, artificial intelligence, e-services and self-organizing systems to support the establishment of digital ecosystems and manage their resources. The International Conference on Management of Digital EcoSystems (MEDES),previously named \"The International Conference on Management of Emergent Digital EcoSystems\", aims to develop and bring together a diverse community from academia, research laboratories and industry interested in exploring the manifold challenges and issues related to resource management of Digital Ecosystems and how current approaches and technologies can be evolved and adapted to this end.

Of particular relevance to ODBASE are papers that bridge traditional boundaries between disciplines such as artificial intelligence and Semantic Web, databases, data science, data analytics and machine learning, human-computer interaction, social networks, distributed and mobile systems, data and information retrieval, knowledge discovery, and computational linguistics.\r\n\r\nThe increasing effectiveness and adoption of data-driven AI technologies into a widening range of applications has thrown a spotlight into the trustworthiness of such AI applications. Such concerns extends beyond those of vendors, deployers and users of an AI, interested in its envelop of performance and reliability, but also wider professional, governmental and civil society stakeholders who are concerned by the potential impact of bias, safety, robustness and liability issues. This concern is amplified by the opaque nature of techniques such as deep machine learning and the ease with which they can be applies over large varieties of datasets and therefore impact is many different areas of life. Key to addressing these concerns therefore is transparency in how data is collected, selected and prepared in training and using AI and how these processes can be governed, not just within organisations, but in concert with external stakeholders. Ontologies and semantic models are powerful techniques for representing, exchanging and controlling the processing of data for AI applications. They can be used to define and monitor integration mappings between data sets that train AI. They can track the provenance and quality assessments of data selected for training AI. They can be use to track and compare the selection of data in different linguistic and societal settings to ensure AI is developed in a fair, unbiased and inclusive manner. They can be used for tracking and explaining the processing of personal data in AI, which is increasingly a requirement for data protection regulation. They can be used to assess the value of datasets and the contributions to that value made by individual stakeholders. They can be use by communities to assemble and share information about applications of AI, to inform approaches to ethical use of AI and thereby establish trust. In all these areas semantic models offer a promising basis for establishing sector-specific or international standards for interoperable data governance in AI applications.\r\n\r\nODBASE’20 intends to draw a highly diverse body of researchers and practitioners by being part of the Federated conferences Event \"On the Move to Meaningful Internet Systems 2020 (OnTheMove\'20)\" that co-locates three conferences: ODBASE\'20, C&TC\'20 (International Symposium on Secure Virtual Infrastructures), and CoopIS\'20 (International Conference on Cooperative Information Systems).\r\n\r\nODBASE 2020 will consider two categories of papers: research and experience.

Over the last two decades, optical communication technologies have increased the transmission capacity per fiber by several orders of magnitude, achieving Tbit/s transmissions. If the data traffic usage continues to increase at the current rate, a further increase in the transmission capacity of several orders of magnitude will be needed over the coming decades. This implies that future optical systems and networks should be able to support capacities well over Peta bit/s. However, the current technologies have already begun to reveal several fundamental limits; the electronic speed limit, the Shannon and quantum limit, and the IP bottleneck. The future technologies must overcome these limits ensuring sustainable growth of network traffic.

Two simultaneous related tracks will be held, covering both applications and current research work. One track focuses on Agents, Multi-Agent Systems and Software Platforms, Distributed Problem Solving and Distributed AI in general. The other track focuses mainly on Artificial Intelligence, Knowledge Representation, Planning, Learning, Scheduling, Perception Reactive AI Systems, and Evolutionary Computing and other topics related to Intelligent Systems and Computational Intelligence.\r\n\r\nA substantial amount of research work is ongoing in these knowledge areas, in an attempt to discover appropriate theories and paradigms to use in real-world applications. Much of this important work is therefore theoretical in nature. However there is nothing as practical as a good theory, as Boltzman said many years ago, and some theories have indeed made their way into practice. Informatics applications are pervasive in many areas of Artificial Intelligence and Distributed AI, including Agents and Multi-Agent Systems; This conference intends to emphasize this connection, therefore, authors are invited to highlight the benefits of Information Technology (IT) in these areas. Ideas on how to solve problems using agents and artificial intelligence, both in R&D and industrial applications, are welcome. Papers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged. Papers describing original work are invited in any of the areas listed below. Accepted papers, presented at the conference by one of the authors, will be published in the Proceedings of ICAART with an ISBN. Acceptance will be based on quality, relevance and originality. Both full research reports and work-in-progress reports are welcome.

Model-Driven Development (MDD) is an approach to the development of IT systems in which models take a central role, not only for analysis of these systems but also for their construction. MDD has emerged from modelling initiatives, most prominently the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) fostered by the Object Management Group (OMG). In the scope of MDA, a couple of technologies have been developed that became the cornerstones of MDD, like metamodelling and model transformations. MDD relies on languages for defining metamodels, like the Meta-Object Facility (MOF) and Ecore (developed in the scope of the Eclipse Modelling Framework), and transformation specification languages like QVT and ATL.\r\n\r\nMDD is already around for some years and is about to become commodity in software development due to its benefits (reduction on development costs, improvement of software quality, reduction of maintenance costs and the support for controlled evolution of IT systems). MDD has also been applied in many application areas, such as real-time and embedded systems, and telecommunication systems, and, more recently, to the development and integration of enterprise information systems. However, the MDD research community is wishing to explore the bounds of MDD, by investigating new applications areas and combinations with other emerging technologies, like, for example, pervasive context-aware systems, semantic web, semantic web services, service-oriented architecture, ontologies and cloud computing. This conference aims at fostering the further development and application of MDD techniques for software systems.\r\n\r\nPapers describing advanced prototypes, systems, tools and techniques and general survey papers indicating future directions are also encouraged.

This can be achieved either by using energy more efficiently (using less energy for a constant service) or by reducing the amount of services used (for example, by driving less). Energy conservation is a part of the concept of eco-sufficiency.

We solicit previously unpublished papers offering novel research contributions in any aspect of security or privacy. Papers may present advances in the theory, design, implementation, analysis, verification, or empirical evaluation and measurement of secure systems.\r\n\r\nTopics of interest include:\r\n\r\n    Access control and authorization\r\n    Anonymity\r\n    Application security\r\n    Attacks and defenses\r\n    Authentication\r\n    Blockchains and distributed ledger security\r\n    Censorship resistance\r\n    Cloud security\r\n    Cyber physical systems security\r\n    Distributed systems security\r\n    Economics of security and privacy\r\n    Embedded systems security\r\n    Forensics\r\n    Hardware security\r\n    Intrusion detection and prevention\r\n    Malware and unwanted software\r\n    Mobile and Web security and privacy\r\n    Language-based security\r\n    Machine learning and AI security\r\n    Network and systems security\r\n    Privacy technologies and mechanisms\r\n    Protocol security\r\n    Secure information flow\r\n    Security and privacy for the Internet of Things\r\n    Security and privacy metrics\r\n    Security and privacy policies\r\n    Security architectures\r\n    Usable security and privacy\r\n    Trustworthy computing\r\n    Web security\r\n\r\nThis topic list is not meant to be exhaustive; S&P is interested in all aspects of computer security and privacy. Papers without a clear application to security or privacy, however, will be considered out of scope and may be rejected without full review.\r\n\r\nSystematization of Knowledge Papers\r\n\r\nAs in past years, we solicit systematization of knowledge (SoK) papers that evaluate, systematize, and contextualize existing knowledge, as such papers can provide a high value to our community. Suitable papers are those that provide an important new viewpoint on an established, major research area, support or challenge long-held beliefs in such an area with compelling evidence, or present a convincing, comprehensive new taxonomy of such an area. Survey papers without such insights are not appropriate and may be rejected without full review. Submissions will be distinguished by the prefix “SoK:” in the title and a checkbox on the submission form. They will be reviewed by the full PC and held to the same standards as traditional research papers, but they will be accepted based on their treatment of existing work and value to the community, and not based on any new research results they may contain. Accepted papers will be presented at the symposium and included in the proceedings.\r\n\r\nQuarterly Submissions\r\n\r\nBased on the experience in the past two years, the reviewing process for IEEE S&P is changed to a quarterly submission model. Within 2.5 months of submission, author notifications of Accept/Revise/Reject decisions will be sent out. For each submission, one of the following decisions will be made:\r\n\r\n    Accept: Papers in this category will be accepted for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference, possibly after making minor changes with the oversight of a shepherd. Within one month of acceptance, all accepted papers must submit a camera-ready copy incorporating reviewer feedback. The papers will immediately be published, open access, in the Computer Society’s Digital Library, and they may be cited as “To appear in the IEEE Symposium on Security & Privacy, May 2021”.\r\n\r\n    Revise: A limited number of papers will be invited to submit a revision; such papers will receive a specific set of expectations to be met by that revision. Authors can submit a revised paper to the next two quarterly submission deadlines after the notification. The authors should clearly explain in a well-marked appendix how the revisions address the comments of the reviewers. The revised paper will then be re-evaluated, and either accepted or rejected.\r\n\r\n    Reject: Papers in this category are declined for inclusion in the conference. Rejected papers must wait for one year, from the date of original submission, to resubmit to IEEE S&P. A paper will be judged to be a resubmit (as opposed to a new submission) if the paper is from the same or similar authors, and a reviewer could write a substantially similar summary of the paper compared with the original submission. As a rule of thumb, if there is more than 40% overlap between the original submission and the new paper, it will be considered a resubmission.\r\n\r\nAll papers accepted by February 21, 2021 will appear in the proceedings of the symposium in May 2021 and invited to present their work. These include papers that were submitted in December 2020 and were accepted without revision, or papers that were submitted by June 2020, got the Revise decision, and resubmitted the revised paper in December.', '2020-05-05 12:06:41.383470', '0', '0', 'A', 'a*', ' ', ' ', '', 'http://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2021/', ' ');

The humanity has witnessed a rapid evolution of this global networking infrastructure: an infrastructure that was looking in the past for networked applications has evolved into an infrastructure struggling to meet the social, technological and business challenges posed by multitude of bandwidth hungry emerging applications. \r\n\r\nSmart city applications are the latest, and most dominant and demanding applications to be supported by the global networking and computing infrastructure. Smart cities provide the state of the art approaches for urbanisation, having evolved from the developments carried out under the umbrella of knowledge-based economy, and subsequently under the notion of digital economy and intelligent economy. Smart cities encompass all aspects of modern day life, transportation, healthcare, entertainment, work, businesses, social interactions, and governance. Smart cities exploit physical and digital infrastructure, as well as the intellectual and social capital, for urban and social development. Technically, smart cities are complex systems of systems that rely on converged and ubiquitous infrastructures. The smart city phenomenon is driven by several interdependent trends including a pressing need for environmental sustainability, and peoples’ increasing demands for personalization, mobility and higher quality of life. \r\n\r\nThe notion of smart cities can be extended to smart societies; i.e. digitally-enabled, knowledge-based societies, aware of and working towards social, environmental and economic sustainability. Since knowledge, and human and social capital are at the heart of smart city and smart society developments, the role of education should extend beyond the mainstream “education for employment” scope. It should extend to the notion of social and collaborative governance where the society collaborates to train each other in maintaining its knowledge, moral fibre, operations, good practice, resilience, competitiveness, and for bringing innovation, and becoming a knowledge-based economy. The key to such efforts would be the creation of an ecosystem of digital infrastructures that are able to work together and enable dynamic real-time interactions between various smart city subsystems.\r\n\r\nWe define smart infrastructure as, “knowledge-based, collaborative, converged, ubiquitous, self-aware, adaptive, resilient, digitally-enabled, and self-governing foundational structure; comprising hard, soft, virtual, and digital facilities and systems, and intellectual and social capital; enabling social, environmental and economic sustainability; enabling innovation and competitiveness; facilitating personalization in all aspects of modern-day and future living, the aspects including transportation, healthcare, entertainment, work, businesses, social interactions, and governance;  to meet societal, economic and other demands of organizations, cities or countries”. Smart infrastructure include Internet of Things (IoT) to monitor and actuate. High performance computing (HPC), big data, artificial intelligence, cloud, fog, and edge computing, and 5G and other communication technologies will be needed to provide the necessary intelligence, storage, compute, and communication resources for the smart infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis Summit SCITA 2020  will bring together decision makers, top researchers, industry executives and government officials to discuss directions of smarter societies research and development.\r\n\r\nWe name this summit SCITA, meaning “the sum of all the political, economic, technological, scientific, military, geographical, and psychological knowledge of the masses and of their representatives”.\r\n\r\nThemes and Tracks:\r\n\r\n    Smarter Society Applications (Healthcare, Mobility, disaster management…)\r\n    Smart Infrastructure (distributed systems, HPC, Big Data, edge computing, 5G …)\r\n    Social Capital Development and eGovernance\r\n    Innovation and Entrepreneurship\r\n    Crosscutting Themes\r\n\r\nTopics\r\n\r\nWe seek novel, innovative, and exciting work in areas including but not limited to:\r\n\r\n    Smart and personalized healthcare systems for smart societies\r\n    Smart transportation systems for smart societies\r\n    Smart buildings, smart homes and smart energy grids\r\n    Computational and artificial Intelligence applications for smart societies\r\n    Big data applications for smart societies\r\n    Mobile applications for smart societies\r\n    Analytics for smart societies\r\n    eGovernance for smart societies\r\n    Social networks and media\r\n    Modelling and analysis of smart society technologies, applications and systems\r\n    High Performance computing infrastructure and applications for smart societies\r\n    Artificial Intelligence methodologies, tools, software for smart societies infrastructure\r\n    Internet and Web infrastructure for smart societies\r\n    IoT based approaches for smart societies infrastructure\r\n    Big data technologies for smart societies infrastructure\r\n    Cloud, fog and edge computing for smart societies\r\n    Studies focussed on communication networks for smart societies\r\n    Information management for smart societies\r\n    Security and privacy of smart society systems\r\n    Innovation and entrepreneurship in smart society settings\r\n    Software defined approaches for system design including networking and interactions\r\n    Social capital development for smart societies\r\n    Lifelong learning for smart societies\r\n    Social capital development for smart societies\r\n    eLearning and distance learning for smart societies\r\n    Collaborative and social learning\r\n    Social intervention methodologies\r\n    Innovation and Entrepreneurship\r\n    Smart citizens\r\n    Smart living and living spaces\r\n    Smart environment\r\n    Smart economy\r\n    Smart Grid\r\n    Industry 4.0\r\n    Gen-Z, Compute Express Link (CXL), and similar developments to support smart cities\r\n    Communication technologies for smart cities including 5G, 6G, V2X, etc.', '2020-05-28 10:24:36.027979', '0', '0', ' ', ' ', ' ', ' ', '', 'http://scita.org', ' ');

The future impact and progress in both AI and Neuroscience will strongly depend on a more efficient synergy and cooperation between the two research communities. These are the goals of the International Course and Symposium – ACAIN 2020, which is aimed both  at AI experts with interests in Neuroscience and at neuroscientists with an interest in AI. ACAIN 2020 will be a special opportunity to hear about cutting-edge research by leading scientists in both fields.

The Course provides a stimulating environment for academics, early career researches, Post-Docs, PhD students and industry leaders. Participants will also have the chance to present their results with oral talks or posters, and to interact with their peers, in a friendly and constructive environment.\r\n\r\nYou will gain a heightened awareness for fields of Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience relevant for your activity and, perhaps most important, you will gain a place within an elite global network of Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience experts.\r\n\r\nThe Advanced Course is not a summer school suited only for younger scholars. Rather, a significant proportion of seasoned investigators are regularly present among the attendees, often senior faculty at their own institutions. The balanced audience that we strive to maintain in each Advanced Course greatly contributes to the development of intense cross-disciplinary debates among faculty and participants that typically address the most advanced and emerging areas of each topic.\r\n\r\nEach faculty member presents lectures and discusses with the participants for one entire day. Such long interaction together with the small, exclusive Course size provides the uncommon opportunity to fully explore the expertise of each faculty, often through one-to-one mentoring. This is unparalleled and priceless.\r\n\r\nThe Course will involve a total of 36-40 hours of lectures, according to the academic system the final achievement will be equivalent to 8 ECTS points for the PhD Students and the Master Students attending the Course.\r\n\r\nThe Wordsworth Hotel & SPA – Grasmere provides the perfect setting to a relaxed yet intense learning atmosphere, with the stunning backdrop of the Lake District landscapes.

Papers not following these guidelines may be rejected without review. Besides, submissions received after the due date, exceeding length limit, or not appropriately structured will not be considered. Authors may contact the Program Chair for further information or clarification.\r\n\r\nAll submissions are blind peer-reviewed by at least three reviewers. Accepted papers will appear in the Conference Proceedings and published by the IEEE Computer Society Conference Publishing Services and will be submitted to IEEE Xplore for inclusion. Submission of regular papers must not exceed 8 pages. Each submission must include, outside the main body of the paper, up to 7 keywords, complete postal and e-mail address, and fax and phone numbers of the corresponding author.

Submitted papers that are deemed of good quality but that could not be accepted as regular papers will be accepted as short papers.\r\n\r\nDouble-Blind Peer Review Guidelines\r\n\r\nAICCSA 2020 uses double-blind review, which means that both the reviewer and author identities are concealed from the reviewers, and vice versa, throughout the review process. To facilitate this, authors need to ensure that their manuscripts are prepared in a way that does not give away their identity or affiliation.\r\n\r\nInformation to help prepare the Blinded Manuscript\r\n\r\nBesides the obvious need to remove names and affiliations under the title within the manuscript, there are other steps that need to be taken to ensure the manuscript is correctly prepared for double-blind peer review. To assist with this process the key items that need to be observed are as follows:\r\n− Use the third person to refer to work the Authors have previously undertaken, e.g. replace any phrases like “as we have shown before” with “… has been shown before [Anonymous, 2007]”.\r\n− Make sure figures do not contain any affiliation related identifier\r\n− Do not eliminate essential self-references or other references but limit self-references only to papers that are relevant for those reviewing the submitted paper.\r\n− Cite papers published by the Author in the text as follows: ‘[Anonymous, 2007]’.\r\n− For blinding in the reference list: ‘[Anonymous 2007] Details omitted for double-blind reviewing.’\r\n− Remove references to funding sources.\r\n− Do not include acknowledgments\r\n− Remove any identifying information, including author names, from file names and ensure document properties are also anonymized.\r\n\r\nSpecial Issues\r\n\r\nSelected papers from the conference will be invited to submit an extended version to the following journal. Papers will be selected based on their reviewers’ scores and appropriateness to the Journal’s topic. All extended versions will undergo reviews and must represent original unpublished research work.

The next generation of telecommunication networks is expected to support a growing number of smart terminals, such as cell phones and sensors, to provide real-time applications and to provide intelligence and trust embedded in network infrastructure. To meet these requirements, the 6G envisions the use of artificial intelligence, cloud, and IoT applications. The 6G network will absorb the billions of flows generated by things while considering the requested QoS and the cohabitation of M2M, M2H and H2M flows. Then, the flows will be processed in data centers and applications will exploit the extracted knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe main objective of CIoT’20 is to address challenges of clouds and IoT systems from the sensors/machines to the end-users attached to the Cloud while considering the 6G network connecting both IoT and Cloud domains.

HotNets provides a venue for discussing innovative ideas and for debating future research agendas in networking.\r\n\r\nWe invite researchers and practitioners to submit short position papers. We encourage papers that identify fundamental open questions, advocate a new approach, offer a constructive critique of the state of networking research, re-frame or debunk existing work, report unexpected early results from a deployment, report on promising but unproven ideas, or propose new evaluation methods. Novel ideas need not be supported by full evaluations; well-reasoned arguments or preliminary evaluations can support the possibility of the paper’s claims.\r\n\r\nWe seek early-stage work, where the authors can benefit from community feedback. An ideal submission has the potential to open a line of inquiry for the community that results in multiple conference papers in related venues (SIGCOMM, SOSP, OSDI, NSDI, MobiCom, MobiSys, CoNEXT, etc.), rather than a single follow-on conference paper. The program committee will explicitly favor early work and papers likely to stimulate reflection and discussion over “conference papers in miniature”. Finished work that fits in a short paper is likely a better fit with the short-paper tracks at either CoNEXT or IMC, for example.\r\n\r\nHotNets takes a broad view of networking research. This includes new ideas relating to (but not limited to) mobile, wide-area, data-center, home, and enterprise networks using a variety of link technologies (wired, wireless, visual, and acoustic), as well as social networks and network architecture. It encompasses all aspects of networks, including (but not limited to) packet-processing hardware and software, virtualization, mobility, provisioning and resource management, performance, energy consumption, topology, robustness and security, measurement, diagnosis, verification, privacy, economics and evolution, interactions with applications, and usability of underlying networking technologies.\r\n\r\nPosition papers will be selected based on originality, likelihood of stimulating insightful discussion at the workshop, and technical merit.

Urban IoT promises to deliver massive amounts of data and fundamentally change our understanding of these systems.

Edge-IoT 2020 conference has been created as a flagship conference aiming at addressing the decentralization of contemporary processing paradigms, notably Edge processing, focusing on the increasing demand for intelligent processing at the edge of the network, which is paving the way to the Intelligent IoT Era.\r\n\r\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is taking an important role in the digital transformation process in several application domains blurring the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds. Traditionally, the data produced by these IoT devices is relayed back to a centralized computing system, also known as a cloud-centered computing paradigm. In this approach, data is centrally processed at the cloud and its results are sent back to the IoT devices, that run on the edge of the network. Since IoT edge devices are becoming more compact, energy-efficient, affordable and incorporate increasing computational power, Intelligent Edge Processing can be used for distributed processing that will take place near the physical location of the data source, i.e. at the network edge, enabling real-time processing with low-latency (allowing a fast and more effective response), and the reduction of the data dimension (integration and aggregation of several data sources collected at the edge), to generate dynamic and structured smart data streams.

The conference covers fundamentals on designing, implementing, testing, validating and maintaining various kinds of software. Several tracks are proposed to treat the topics from theory to practice, in terms of methodologies, design, implementation, testing, use cases, tools, and lessons learned. The conference topics cover classical and advanced methodologies, open source, agile software, as well as software deployment and software economics and education.\r\n\r\nOther advanced aspects are related to on-time practical aspects, such as run-time vulnerability checking, rejuvenation process, updates partial or temporary feature deprecation, software deployment and configuration, and on-line software updates. These aspects trigger implications related to patenting, licensing, engineering education, new ways for software adoption and improvement, and ultimately, to software knowledge management.\r\n\r\nThere are many advanced applications requiring robust, safe, and secure software: disaster recovery applications, vehicular systems, biomedical-related software, biometrics related software, mission critical software,  E-health related software, crisis-situation software. These applications require appropriate software engineering techniques, metrics and formalisms, such as, software reuse, appropriate software quality metrics, composition and integration,  consistency checking, model checking, provers and reasoning.\r\n\r\nThe nature of research in software varies slightly with the specific discipline researchers work in, yet there is much common ground and room for a sharing of best practice, frameworks, tools, languages and methodologies. Despite the number of experts we have available, little work is done at the meta level, that is examining how we go about our research, and how this process can be improved. There are questions related to the choice of programming language, IDEs and documentation styles and standard. Reuse can be of great benefit to research projects, yet reuse of prior research projects introduces special problems that need to be mitigated. The research environment is a mix of creativity and systematic approach which leads to a creative tension that needs to be managed or at least monitored. Much of the coding in any university is undertaken by research students or young researchers. Issues of skills training, development and quality control can have significant effects on an entire department. In an industrial research setting the environment is not quite that of industry as a whole, nor does it follow the pattern set by the university. The unique approaches and issues of industrial research may hold lessons for researchers in other domains.\r\n\r\nWe solicit both academic, research, and industrial contributions. We welcome technical papers presenting research and practical results, position papers addressing the pros and cons of specific proposals, such as those being discussed in the standard fora or in industry consortia, survey papers addressing the key problems and solutions on any of the above topics short papers on work in progress, and panel proposals.\r\n\r\nIndustrial presentations are not subject to the format and content constraints of regular submissions. We expect short and long presentations that express industrial position and status.\r\n\r\nTutorials on specific related topics and panels on challenging areas are encouraged.\r\n\r\nThe topics suggested by the conference can be discussed in term of concepts, state of the art, research, standards, implementations, running experiments, applications, and industrial case studies. Authors are invited to submit complete unpublished papers, which are not under review in any other conference or journal in the following, but not limited to, topic areas.\r\n\r\nAll topics and submission formats are open to both research and industry contributions.\r\n\r\nICSEA 2020 conference tracks:\r\n\r\nTrends and achievements\r\n\r\nAdvanced agile software development;

Underwater operations and applications are quite limited by comparison. Most applications refer to remotely controlled submersibles and wide-area data collection systems at a coarse granularity.\r\n\r\nUnderwater sensor networks have many potential applications such a seismic imaging of undersea oilfields as a representative application. Oceanographic research is also based on the advances in underwater data collection systems.\r\n\r\nThere are specific technical aspects to realize underwater applications which can not be borrowed from the ground-based sensors net research. Radio is not suitable for underwater systems because of extremely limited propagation. Acoustic telemetry could be used in underwater communication; however off-the-shelf acoustic modems are not recommended for underwater sensor networks with hundreds of nodes because they were designed for long-range and expensive. As the speed of light (radio) is five orders of magnitude higher than the speed of sound, there are fundamental implications of time synchronization and propagation delays for localization. Additionally, existing communication protocols are not designed to deal with long sleep times and they can\'t shut down and quickly restart.\r\n\r\nIn wireless sensor and micro-sensor networks energy consumption is a key factor for the sensor lifetime and accuracy of information. Protocols and mechanisms have been proposed for energy optimization considering various communication factors and types of applications. Conserving energy and optimizing energy consumption are challenges in wireless sensor networks, requiring energy-adaptive protocols, self-organization, and balanced forwarding mechanisms.\r\n\r\nAs a multi-track event, SENSORCOMM 2020 will serve as a forum for researchers from the academia and the industry, professionals, standard developers, policy makers and practitioners to exchange ideas.

Security affects business and individuals, raises the business risk, and requires a corporate and individual culture. In the open business space offered by Internet, it is a need to improve defences against hackers, disgruntled employees, and commercial rivals. There is a required balance between the effort and resources spent on security versus security achievements. Some vulnerability can be addressed using the rule of 80:20, meaning 80% of the vulnerabilities can be addressed for 20% of the costs. Other technical aspects are related to the communication speed versus complex and time consuming cryptography/security mechanisms and protocols.\r\n\r\nDigital Ecosystem is defined as an open decentralized information infrastructure where different networked agents, such as enterprises (especially SMEs), intermediate actors, public bodies and end users, cooperate and compete enabling the creation of new complex structures. In digital ecosystems, the actors, their products and services can be seen as different organisms and species that are able to evolve and adapt dynamically to changing market conditions.\r\n\r\nDigital Ecosystems lie at the intersection between different disciplines and fields: industry, business, social sciences, biology, and cutting edge ICT and its application driven research. They are supported by several underlying technologies such as semantic web and ontology-based knowledge sharing, self-organizing intelligent agents, peer-to-peer overlay networks, web services-based information platforms, and recommender systems.\r\n\r\nTo enable safe digital ecosystem functioning, security and trust mechanisms become essential components across all the technological layers. The aim is to bring together multidisciplinary research that ranges from technical aspects to socio-economic models.\r\n\r\nAs a multi-track event, SECURWARE 2020 will serve as a forum for researchers from the academia and the industry, professionals, standard developers, policy makers and practitioners to exchange ideas.

Nanotechnologies and micro-technologies already made their mark on smart materials, nano-medicine, nano-devices, molecular manufacturing, biotechnology, metrology, airspace.\r\n\r\nThe advancements in material science and computer science have allowed the building, launching and deploying of space exploration systems that continually do more and more as they become smaller and lighter. As an example, carbon nano-tubes have been created that are 250 times stronger than steel, 10 times lighter, and transparent. Similar advances are occurring in glass, plastics and concrete. Spacecraft are being launched, with hulls that are composed of carbon fibers, a light weight high strength material.\r\n\r\nSwarms is another concept of nano-robotics; swarms act in unison like bees. They theoretically will act as a flexible cloth like material, as strong as diamond. Interplanetary exploration can be foreseen as being carried on by nano-robots as well.\r\n\r\nElectronic devices, medicine, environment, metrology, aerospace programs, clothes and materials, telecommunications, cryptography, semiconductors, manufacturing, and other domains are impacted by the progress on the areas mentioned above. Particularly, micro imaging, nano-medicine: (drug delivery; nano-particles i.e. viruses; proteins.), bio-nanostructures: (nano-tubes, nano-particles), microsystems, micro fluidics: (including nano-fluidics, modeling; fabrication and application), micro instrumentation / implantable microdevices (miniaturized bio-electronic systems etc.) and micro sensors benefits from the progress on quantum, nano and micro technologies.\r\n\r\nThe International Conference on Quantum-, Nano- and Micro-technologies (ICQNM 2020) continues a series of events covering particularly promising theories and technologies. The conference covers fundamentals on designing, implementing, testing, validating and maintaining various kinds of materials, systems, techniques and mechanisms related to quantum-, nano- and micro-technologies.\r\n\r\nDeveloping nanoscale-manufactured robots presents fabrication and control challenges. The evolution of mechatronics system and robotic system requires advanced functions for control. Special methods and technologies have been developed to design, analyze, build, controls, and apply micro/nano-robotic systems for biotechnology, medical, information technology, materials, etc. A particular application of nano-robots would be in carrying out projects in hostile environments, utilizing local materials and local energy. Ultra-miniature robotic systems and nano-mechanical devices will be the biomolecular electro-mechanical hardware of future manufacturing and biomedical industry.\r\n\r\nNowadays, there are tremendous attempts to develop new bio-molecular machines, components that can be assembled in nano-devices. Bio-robotics entities are able to manipulate the nano-world components, convey information from the nano/nano to the nano/macro world and navigate at the nano-environment level. Additionally, they are able to self replicate, leading to the bio-robot factory. Protein-based nano-motors and nano-robots, as well as biomolecular components interfaces.\r\n\r\nQuantum cryptography uses the uncertainty principle of quantum physics to provide a safe but public means for transmitting vital, secret information. A quantum public key distribution system depends on the uncertainty principle to ensure secrecy. Special protocols correlations and composability algorithms ensure similar functionality as in non-quantum systems. The security related tracks cover a series of events focusing on quantum security aspects. On the quantum protocol side, automated proofs of security and probabilistic model-checking methods have been suggested. Research teams focus on quantum key distribution and aspects related to key composability and correlations. Limitations are mainly related to physical devices and polarization control.\r\n\r\nClassical methods for reasoning on security, discovering security vulnerabilities and building secure quantum cryptographic systems must be revisited.\r\n\r\nWe solicit both academic, research, and industrial contributions.
